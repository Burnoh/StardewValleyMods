    "npc.Abigail_spouse": "Do you know why I was afraid to go surfing, @?#$b#Somebody online was talking about a sea monster that lives underneath the water. I know I shouldn't believe everything I read, but it sounded so authentic!",
    "npc.Leah_spouse": "If you join in on the fun I'll be cheering you on!$h",
    "npc.Maru_spouse": "Think you can beat me in the surfing competition? How about loser makes dinner tonight?",
    "npc.Penny_spouse": "Have you decided if you're going to join in on the fun @? I'll be cheering you on! You can do it!$h",
    "npc.Haley_spouse": "I'm happy to stay on land and watch everyone surf. Emily thinks it would be good for me to try exciting things, but this is a bit much for me.",
    "npc.Sebastian_spouse": "What do you think is under the water? Abigail sent me a post about a sea creature living underneath. Do you think that's true?",
    "npc.Sam_spouse": "I wanted to participate, but my mom thinks it's best for me not to because of Vincent. She doesn't want him getting any ideas and I can't blame her. He's a wild little bother.",
    "npc.Alex_spouse": "You don't have to worry about me. I withdrew my entry since Sam couldn't join in. We were gonna see who was the fastest: me or the skateboarder.",
    "npc.Harvey_spouse": "Please don't get hurt, @. I don't want you colliding into a rock and hitting your head.",
    "npc.Elliott_spouse": "Sometimes I miss that old, drafty cabin. But our home is much nicer.",
    "npc.Emily_spouse": "I still try to push Haley to try new things. She always talked about getting out of Pelican Town, but where in the city could she ride some waves?",
    "npc.Abigail": "Do you plan on participating in the race, @?#$b#I wanted to, but I'm a little afraid of what might be in the water....$3",
    "npc.Emily": "Haley always wants to try exciting things, but she didn't want to participate in the race.#$b#So I took her place! Best of luck to you @!$h",
    "npc.Robin": "Lewis asked me to make some surfboards since they were too expensive to import.",
    "npc.Demetrius": "Did you know Maru surfed? I didn't! This valley is full of secrets, even some that aren't scientific.",
    "npc.Maru": "Mmm, I'm a little nervous about the surfing competition, but Harvey said he'd participate with me.",
    "npc.Sebastian": "I could use some adrenaline, but I'll stick to my bike.",
    "npc.Linus": "I would much rather be swimming in the water than surfing on top of it.",
    "npc.Pierre": "Take a look at all the surfboards Robin made. I'm honored to sell such fine craftsmanship.",
    "npc.Caroline": "I always love these types of festivals. It's so nice to be surrounded by friends and food, and it's great to see the kids have fun.",
    "npc.Alex": "I was going to show off these muscles and race Sam but he backed out last minute.",
    "npc.George": "I used to surf back in my youth. Went to Oahu and Tavarua if you can believe this old man.",
    "npc.Evelyn": "Did you know George used to be a surfer back in the day?#$b#I didn't know him when he surfed, but he's shown me pictures of him riding the waves.#$b#He's always been so handsome.$h",
    "npc.Lewis": "If you haven't already, don't forget to add some fuel to the bonfire.#$b#We want everyone to be warm during the competition.",
    "npc.Clint": "I've spent most of my life in Pelican Town, @, and I never would have said somebody could surf on these waters.$s",
    "npc.Penny": "I'm looking forward to the surfing competition later! Do you think I should start preparing for next year, @?",
    "npc.Pam": "We've never had a festival like this in the valley before you got here, @. No way Lewis thought up this on his own.",
    "npc.Haley": "Emily kept saying how I should try out surfing but I don't want my hair getting ruined.#$b#A swim cap? No! That would look horrible.$a",
    "npc.Jodi": "I managed to talk the boys out of surfing this year.#$b#Sam's a natural because of his skateboarding, but I don't want him hurting himself on a rock or getting caught up in a net.#$b#Vincent? He's too young, but maybe when he's older.",
    "npc.Kent": "Jodi should have let the kids participate this year. They're young. They need to experience more positive things in their lives.",
    "npc.Marlon": "There isn't a sword or bow on this planet that can damage the waves. Best of luck to you, @.",
    "npc.Sam": "Alex wanted to race, but I just want to relax. I had the perfect excuse too.",
    "npc.Leah": "I'm staying on land to get inspiration for my next art piece. Maybe I'll call it Valley Waves.",
    "npc.Shane": "I'm looking forward to the race later! We have an extra board if you want to participate @.",
    "npc.Marnie": "Lewis told me that Shane signed up for the race. It was startling at first, but I know he can win.",
    "npc.Elliott": "I'm not terribly fond of my front lawn being taken over, but this festival is quite fun.#$b#Perhaps I'll practice balancing on a surfboard in one of the tide pools.",
    "npc.Gus": "I always love getting to spend a day out of the saloon. This festival is going to be great.$h",
    "npc.Dwarf": "On the surface, people aren't afraid of water. They ride it. But down here? The water rushes in through the cracks.",
    "npc.Wizard": "Do you require an arcane charm to improve your luck in the competition?",
    "npc.Harvey": "*gulp* Why did I agree to try this out? I've never been surfing before.$s",
    "npc.Sandy": "There's a festival happening! I'm so excited!",
    "npc.Jas": "Shane's gonna win the surfing competition!$h",
    "npc.Vincent": "Mom said I'm not old enough to go surfing.$s",
    "npc.Willy": "Sometimes I can hear the waves crashing against the dock. I hope the kids know what they're doing. The sea, she can be a rough one.",
